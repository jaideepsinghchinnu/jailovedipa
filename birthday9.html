                    <p>Hi Dipa, it's me Jai Deep. Your Man. Hope you will love this present. I am not good at narrating. And you know I was not feeling well. So don't mind about my english. Let's begin! On Nov 13th, it is a special day. I asked for VC but your mom is with you. I revealed the speciality of that day. And you are so happy after hearing it. Do you know what it is? Its 143 days to go for your birthday 💗</p>

                    <p>Hi Dipa. On 12 Dec in the morning. I was travelling to my college. During the travel we made VC. I also talked with your brother. I asked him a question that can I marry his sister [Dipanwita], he answered YES! Then you asked him who is hot? Then he replied it's you! And last question was whom he likes? He said ME! But instantly he turned his face towards you and said "But I like you more!" Ahh! He is claver boy! You were wearing a brown hoddie. You were making Egg-sandwiches for your brother and yourself for breakfast. When you were preparing the food I was fantasizing that how you will gonna cook for me in the future! Do you remember that day I took screenshots when you were eating and I showed you them to you. You were like child and making rounds on the floor 😂 I LOVE YOUR SMILE 💗 Cute girl, cute things! Later we played UNO together 3 of us until your mom came home. Hey I also asked one more question your brother that there are many boys outside but why me? Then he replied that i am PERFECT for YOU 🌸</p>

                    <p>On 13th Dec, you were worrying about your exams. Then I wanted to tell you something from the bottom of my heart. What I told is... Dipa I am proud of you. I am happy for you. Not because of bla bla bla. I am proud of you because you work hard for what you want! You have worked hard for your exams and tensioned about it. You have taken care of your career. I am proud of you baby. I am happy about it. You have replied, "Awwwww. Thanks sona". You know what you did? You called me SONA for 1st time. I felt great about it. I think I helped you. But you did make me over to the sky by calling me SONA ✨ I LOVE YOU DIPA 💗</p>

                    <p>Hey, On 14th Dec. I went out with my sister to buy some groceries I think so. I captured a pic of shadow me and my shadow. And I kept it on story. Do you remember what you replied? You asked who she is. And immediately you kept bye. Baka Baka. You are jealous. She's my sister. Actually it is so cute that you have fallen in love in such a way deeply. So jealous and anger. My angry bird. My cute little angry bird. Love you Dipa 💗 Love You My Angry Bird!</p>

                    <p>Hey, on 16 Dec, you have an exam. So we met early in the morning. I tried for VC but you said no. After a long conversation you finally accepted it. Do you remember what you ware? You were waring a mask! And covering yourself with cloth [blanket/we cover ourself while sleeping] to avoid cold. Can I tell how did you look? You looked like an ninja 🥷🏼 just 2 knives and blades are missing. Hehe. I felt that who is she? Is she a ninja? 😅 You are preparing for your exam so I don't wanna disturb you, so I was writing and then in middle, you were silently looking at me with two sharp eyes 💗</p>

                    <p>Do you know why I ask you for VC's? I want to see you every time. To see your smile. And to feel your presence and love. To make us feel that we are together. As I am for you and you are for me. Be with me as who you are Dipa. Be with me as who you are! As a child. Smile with me, cherish me, I will cherish you. Your smile, your eyes, your cute expressions like a child. Funny crazy weird and all. I love them. I LOVE YOU 💗</p>

                    <p>Hi, On 22nd Dec. I woke up 4 times. 3 times in the middle of the night near to the morning. Do you know why? I dreamed about you. That you sent me sms (Text/message). And I got alert in my mind, that you are here then I woke up and I check my phone for your message. It just not about that one day. It used to happen with me frequently 💗</p>

                    <p>Hello, on 26th Dec at 3pm I received your text. From 3pm to 7:10 or 7:30 we were together. Most of the time on VC. Special thing, my special path and favorite path is staring at you (looking in your eyes). Staring at your face. Staring at your smile. And one more special thing is, you gave me kisses, all of sudden. Then I was like 'Ahhhhhh' and been stuck staring at you silently. Those all sudden kisses you gave me were when you felt that I was cute. You have gave me a lot of sudden kissed that day. After our cute conversation, you wore white shirt 😉 I it is shirt so. In that tight shirt I can able to see your upper body shape. You teased me a lot. Even though I was interested in your smile. Haha. The smile you have ahhhh 💗 You told me that no one ever complimented that your smile is cute. Your smile is really very cute baby. You also gave me a statement that you did not feel like you are in a relationship, because you don't feel any toxic. And you could able to focus in your studies. And you are happy with me. Love You Dipa.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I wrote a lot thing which I wanted to tell you. But I am not able to express them. On 14th Jan, we made our 1st VC in 2025. I remembered the date so strongly because we made VC and you were crying. You were crying looking at me. I asked why are you crying. Then said that those are happy tears, since we met after long gap. I LOVE YOU DIPA 💗</p>
